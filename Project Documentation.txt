CORE COMPONENTS
===============

1. SERVER.JS - MULTIPLAYER BACKEND
----------------------------------
**Purpose**: Handles all multiplayer communication, room management, and game data synchronization.

**Key Features**:
- Room-based multiplayer with unique 4-character codes
- Seeded random number generation for synchronized game data
- Real-time communication between players
- Game state management and synchronization

**Critical Functions**:
```javascript
// Room Management
socket.on('createRoom', (roomCode) => { ... })
socket.on('joinRoom', (roomCode) => { ... })

// Game Data Generation
generateVirusPositions(roomCode)    // Creates unique virus layouts per room
generateRandomList(roomCode)        // Creates unique pill color sequences per room
generateNewGameData(roomCode)       // Orchestrates data generation and storage

// Player Communication
socket.on('sendDamage', (data) => { ... })
socket.on('updatePoints', (data) => { ... })
```

**Synchronization System**:
- Each room gets unique virus positions based on room code + timestamp
- Each room gets unique pill color sequences for fair gameplay
- Data is generated once per room and shared with all players
- Seeded random generation ensures reproducibility

2. GAME.JS - UNIFIED GAME CONTROLLER
-----------------------------------
**Purpose**: Main game orchestrator that manages the entire game lifecycle for both single-player and multiplayer modes.

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic player number support (1 or 2)
- Multiplayer state management and synchronization
- Game lifecycle management (start, level progression, game over)
- Socket.IO integration for real-time communication
- Shared game data initialization

**Critical Functions**:
```javascript
constructor(playerNumber = 1)           // Supports both players
initializeWithSharedData()              // Syncs with server data
setupSocketListeners()                  // Handles multiplayer events
nextStage()                             // Level progression
endGame()                               // Game over handling
showWinScreen() / showOpponentWinScreen() // Victory/defeat displays
```

**Multiplayer Integration**:
- Receives shared game data from server
- Synchronizes virus positions and pill colors
- Handles damage transmission between players
- Manages victory/defeat scenarios

3. BOARD.JS - UNIFIED GAME LOGIC
--------------------------------
**Purpose**: Core game mechanics including pill movement, virus management, scoring, and multiplayer damage system.

**Key Features**:
- 8x17 game grid management
- Pill movement, rotation, and placement
- Virus spawning and elimination
- Line clearing mechanics (3+ matching colors)
- Gravity system for falling pieces
- Multiplayer damage system
- Score tracking and display

**Critical Functions**:
```javascript
constructor(game, level = 0, score = 0, playerNumber = 1)  // Dynamic player support
nextFrame()                                                // Main game loop
spawnViruses()                                            // Places viruses at game start
clearIfNeeded()                                           // Checks for line clears
useGravitation()                                          // Makes pieces fall
hurt()                                                    // Receives damage from opponent
spawnRandomDot()                                          // Creates falling damage pieces
```

**Game Mechanics**:
- Pills fall from top and can be rotated/moved
- Matching 3+ same colors in row/column clears them
- Clearing lines eliminates viruses of matching colors
- Multiplayer damage sends falling pieces to opponent

4. SHAPE.JS - UNIFIED GAME PIECES
---------------------------------
**Purpose**: Defines and manages all game pieces including pills, viruses, and their interactions.

**Key Features**:
- Pill class: Two-colored capsules with rotation mechanics
- Virus class: Single-colored targets for elimination
- ShapePiece class: Individual components of shapes
- Movement validation and collision detection
- Shared pill color system for multiplayer fairness

**Critical Functions**:
```javascript
// Pill Management
class Pill extends Shape {
    constructor(board, color1, color2)  // Dynamic positioning
    createPieces(color1, color2)        // Creates pill components
}

// Color System
randomColor()                           // Uses shared server data
updateNumber()                          // Advances through color list
```

**Synchronization Features**:
- Uses server-provided pill color sequences
- Ensures both players get identical pill colors
- Position tracking for fair color consumption
- Fallback to default colors if server data unavailable

5. COMPONENTS.JS - GAME CONSTANTS
---------------------------------
**Purpose**: Centralized configuration for all game constants, colors, and timing.

**Key Data**:
```javascript
export const Color = {
    NONE: "",      // Empty/transparent
    FIRST: "bl",   // Blue
    SECOND: "br",  // Brown
    THIRD: "yl",   // Yellow
}

export const Direction = {
    UP: { x: 0, y: 1 },
    LEFT: { x: -1, y: 0 },
    DOWN: { x: 0, y: -1 },
    RIGHT: { x: 1, y: 0 },
}

export const DELAY = {
    frame: 600,                // Main game loop timing
    readInput: 166,            // Input responsiveness
    gravitation: 90,           // Gravity timing
    // ... other timing constants
}
```

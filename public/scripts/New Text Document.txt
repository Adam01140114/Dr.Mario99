üìã Board.js & Board2.js Unification Analysis & Game Plan
üîç Key Discrepancies Identified:
1. Import Statements
Board.js: import { Pill, Virus } from "./Shape.js" + import { Color, Direction, Rotation, DELAY } from "./components.js"
Board2.js: import { Pill, Virus } from "./Shape2.js" + import { Color, Direction, Rotation, DELAY } from "./components2.js"
2. Player Number Variables
Board.js: var player = 1;
Board2.js: var player = 2;
3. Damage System (Critical Difference)
Board.js:
Listens for: socket.on('p1damage', ...)
Sends: socket.emit('updatePoints2', { player1points: localpoints, roomCode: roomCode })
Board2.js:
Listens for: socket.on('p2damage', ...)
Sends: socket.emit('updatePoints1', { player2points: localpoints, roomCode: roomCode })
4. Input Blocking Logic
Board.js: Has commented out blockInput checks in movementFromKey() and createKeyboardListeners()
Board2.js: Has active blockInput checks in both methods
5. Virus Spawn Height
Board.js: this.maxVirusHeight = 5
Board2.js: this.maxVirusHeight = 10
6. Damage Drop Variables
Board.js: var undery = 14; (and undery2, undery3, undery4)
Board2.js: var undery = 6; (and undery2, undery3, undery4)
7. Missing Function in Board2.js
Board.js: Has requestRandomNumber() function
Board2.js: Missing this function
8. Spawn Counter Logic
Board.js: Has spawn = spawn - 1; in damage drop logic
Board2.js: Missing some spawn = spawn - 1; statements in damage drop logic
9. Block Input Setting
Board.js: No this.blockInput = true; in nextFrame()
Board2.js: Has this.blockInput = true; in nextFrame()
üéØ Unification Strategy:
Phase 1: Dynamic Player Detection
Add player number detection similar to Game.js
Make all player-specific logic dynamic based on detected player number
Phase 2: Socket Event Unification
Create dynamic socket event names based on player number
Use this.playerNumber to determine which events to listen for and send
Phase 3: Configuration Unification
Make virus spawn height, damage drop positions, and other configs dynamic
Use player-specific configurations where needed
Phase 4: Input Blocking Unification
Standardize input blocking logic across both players
Ensure consistent behavior
Phase 5: Missing Feature Integration
Add missing functions from Board.js to unified version
Ensure all spawn counter logic is consistent
üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan:
Create unified Board.js with dynamic player detection
Implement dynamic socket events based on player number
Add player-specific configurations for virus height, damage positions
Standardize input blocking and spawn counter logic
Test damage system to ensure it works correctly
Delete Board2.js and update Game.js to always import from Board.js
‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Considerations:
Damage System: Must maintain correct player-to-player damage flow
Socket Events: Must use correct event names for each player
Game Balance: Virus spawn heights and damage positions may be intentionally different
Input Handling: Block input logic differences may be intentional for game balance
Ready to proceed with the unification? This will be the most complex unification due to the damage system and player-specific configurations.

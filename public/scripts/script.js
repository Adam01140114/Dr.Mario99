/**
 * DR. MARIO 99 - MAIN SCRIPT LOADER
 * =================================
 * 
 * This is the main entry point that was consolidated from separate
 * script.js and script2.js files. It now dynamically determines
 * which player to create based on the visible game container.
 * 
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * - Dynamic player detection based on visible containers
 * - Single game instance per player
 * - Prevention of duplicate instances
 * - Player-specific game creation
 * 
 * CONSOLIDATION BENEFITS:
 * - Single script file for both players
 * - Dynamic player assignment
 * - Reduced code duplication
 * - Centralized game initialization

# RENDER DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
# ================================

## OVERVIEW
This document explains how to switch between localhost development and Render.com production deployment for the Dr. Mario 99 game.

## CURRENT STATE (LOCALHOST DEVELOPMENT)
The game is currently configured for localhost development with the following changes:

### Files Modified for Localhost:
1. **public/index.html** - Line 439
2. **server.js** - Lines 10 and 16
3. **public/scripts/Board.js** - Line 59
4. **public/scripts/Board2.js** - Line 60

## CHANGES MADE FOR LOCALHOST DEVELOPMENT

### 1. Socket.IO Connection (public/index.html)
**BEFORE (Render):**
```javascript
const socket = io('https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/');
```

**AFTER (Localhost):**
```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/');
```

### 2. CORS Configuration (server.js)
**BEFORE (Render only):**
```javascript
const io = socketIo(server, {
    cors: { origin: "https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/" },
});

app.use(cors({
    origin: 'https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/'
}));
```

**AFTER (Both localhost and Render):**
```javascript
const io = socketIo(server, {
    cors: { origin: ["https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/", "http://localhost:3000"] },
});

app.use(cors({
    origin: ['https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/', 'http://localhost:3000']
}));
```

### 3. Game Script Socket Connections
**BEFORE (Render):**
```javascript
// In public/scripts/Board.js and Board2.js
const socket = io('https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/');
```

**AFTER (Localhost):**
```javascript
// In public/scripts/Board.js and Board2.js
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/');
```

## HOW TO REVERT TO RENDER PRODUCTION

### Step 1: Change Socket Connections Back to Render
In **public/index.html** on line 439, change:
```javascript
// FROM:
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/');

// TO:
const socket = io('https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/');
```

In **public/scripts/Board.js** on line 59, change:
```javascript
// FROM:
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/');

// TO:
const socket = io('https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/');
```

In **public/scripts/Board2.js** on line 60, change:
```javascript
// FROM:
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/');

// TO:
const socket = io('https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/');
```

### Step 2: Update CORS Configuration for Render Only
In **server.js** on lines 10 and 16, change:

**Line 10:**
```javascript
// FROM:
cors: { origin: ["https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/", "http://localhost:3000"] },

// TO:
cors: { origin: "https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/" },
```

**Line 16:**
```javascript
// FROM:
origin: ['https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/', 'http://localhost:3000']

// TO:
origin: 'https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/'
```

## HOW TO SWITCH BACK TO LOCALHOST DEVELOPMENT

### Step 1: Change Socket Connections to Localhost
In **public/index.html** on line 439, change:
```javascript
// FROM:
const socket = io('https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/');

// TO:
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/');
```

In **public/scripts/Board.js** on line 59, change:
```javascript
// FROM:
const socket = io('https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/');

// TO:
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/');
```

In **public/scripts/Board2.js** on line 60, change:
```javascript
// FROM:
const socket = io('https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/');

// TO:
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/');
```

### Step 2: Update CORS Configuration for Both
In **server.js** on lines 10 and 16, change:

**Line 10:**
```javascript
// FROM:
cors: { origin: "https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/" },

// TO:
cors: { origin: ["https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/", "http://localhost:3000"] },
```

**Line 16:**
```javascript
// FROM:
origin: 'https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/'

// TO:
origin: ['https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/', 'http://localhost:3000']
```

## DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Deploying to Render:
1. ✅ Change socket connection to Render URL
2. ✅ Update CORS to allow Render origin only
3. ✅ Test locally with Render URL (if possible)
4. ✅ Commit and push changes to Git
5. ✅ Deploy to Render.com

### Before Local Development:
1. ✅ Change socket connection to localhost
2. ✅ Update CORS to allow both origins
3. ✅ Start local server with `node server.js`
4. ✅ Test at http://localhost:3000

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

### Why These Changes Were Made:
- **CORS Issue**: The original CORS configuration only allowed connections from the Render domain, blocking localhost development
- **Socket Connection**: The client was trying to connect to the Render server from localhost, causing CORS errors

### Current Configuration Benefits:
- Supports both localhost development and Render production
- No need to change code when switching between environments
- Maintains security by allowing only specific origins

### Testing:
- **Localhost**: http://localhost:3000
- **Render**: https://dr-mario99.onrender.com/

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:
1. **CORS Errors**: Make sure both origins are in the CORS configuration
2. **Connection Refused**: Ensure the correct URL is used for the environment
3. **Socket Not Connecting**: Check that the server is running and accessible

### Quick Fix Commands:
```bash
# Start local server
node server.js

# Check if server is running
netstat -an | findstr :3000

# Test localhost connection
start http://localhost:3000
```
